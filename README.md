### csidex
_csidex_ is a Java framework providing networking, persistence, and configuration support for real-time interactive collective action experiments. For concrete examples, see the [foraging](https://github.com/virtualcommons/foraging) and [irrigation](https://github.com/virtualcommons/irrigation) experiments. 


### goals
The framework was extracted from several years of experience developing interactive collective action experiments with 10-30 participants in a computer lab with support for parameterized configuration, automatic binary and XML-based persistence of experiment data, and basic networking. However, it has not been under active development for several years now and there are many areas that could be improved including:

1. integration with http://netty.io for more robust networking support
2. web-based deployment
3. data export tools

This framework is _not under active development_ at this time as we are more focused on [developing large scale collective action experiments over the web](https://github.com/virtualcommons/vcweb). If you'd like to use csidex in developing new experiments or customizing any of our existing experiments, please [let us know](http://vcweb.asu.edu/contact).

For more information on how to design and develop experiments using csidex, please refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/virtualcommons/csidex/wiki/Developer-Documentation).

Development has been supported by the [Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity](http://csid.asu.edu) and the [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov).
